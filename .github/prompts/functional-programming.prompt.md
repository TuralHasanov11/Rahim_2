Your goal is to go through Functional Programming page and generate the refactored code according to the examples and use cases defined in #notion Functional Programming page.

Analyze the source code and decide which parts can be refactored to follow functional programming principles.

The programming language used in the notion page is C#, however, you can apply the same principles to the TypeScript, Python, and JavaScript codebase.
