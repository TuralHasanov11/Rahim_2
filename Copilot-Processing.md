# Copilot Processing - City Map Web App

## User Request
Create a page where we will grab the city from a URL parameter and generate a simple map in Mapbox. It will have a main pin which points the city itself with a circle (30 km radius) and other pins inside the circle will point some locations. Each pin represents a company in home services industry that has name, Id, and production volume fields. When clicking upon each one, display information about the company. Show the map for Berlin with some dummy companies.
